Mini App Name: DeFi Yield Aggregator

Description:
DeFi Yield Aggregator provides users with real-time information on the best yield opportunities across multiple DeFi platforms. Instantly compare APYs, staking rewards, and lending returns to maximize profits.

Key Features:
 • Aggregates yield rates from multiple DeFi protocols.
 • Shows real-time APYs for staking, lending, and farming.
 • Visual charts comparing returns across platforms.
 • Supports multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, etc.).
 • Alerts for top-performing pools or significant yield changes.

Target Users:
DeFi investors, yield farmers, and crypto traders who want to optimize returns across multiple protocols and chains.

Usage Instructions:
 1. Select the blockchain(s) and protocols to track.
 2. View real-time yield rates and pool performance.
 3. Compare APYs across protocols and chains.
 4. Set alerts for pools reaching high APY thresholds.

Benefits:
 • Quickly identify the most profitable DeFi opportunities.
 • Save time by viewing multiple protocols in a single dashboard.
 • Stay informed about changing yields and market trends.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can see its current contents and propose the exact changes. Once that file is added, I’ll also create the new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.
